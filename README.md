## seafile11-dark-css
Some CSS that has been hobbled together to work with Seafile Pro 11.

The original CSS that I based this on is available here: https://box.yblis.fr/#s/9t10cezQ

This should work on both Pro and CE but I'm not 100% sure. If you find any elements that are messed up, feel free to make a discussion/issue about it and I'll take a look. Or feel free to fix it. Like I said, this CSS is hobbled together.
